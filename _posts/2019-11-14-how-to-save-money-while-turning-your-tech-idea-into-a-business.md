Starting a start-up is about developing a vision, turning an idea into reality and making your dream come true. How much money can your company make in the best and worst case? You can answer these questions if you want to know whether it is a financially viable start-up or a lifestyle company.

Every founder knows how much time, effort and money he needs to start, develop and grow. That's life when you make it big as the founder of a tech start-up, but what about the rest of life? Even if you are a coding streaker, you are unlikely to be able to build one yourself, so what does it take to get started? There is no better time to try to come up with a great idea and turn it into a high-growth technology company than now. You don't need a fortune to get your business off the ground, and about a third of successful businesses start with less than $5,000. If you raise the money you need, you should be able to start and grow your business in a short time.

If you are planning to sell an actual product, use computer-aided design (CAD) and create a model to ensure that the product works as you imagine it to work. One of the most common tips for entrepreneurs working on a new business plan is to create a similar model to estimate the cost of acquiring customers. In the early days of your business, you will not be able to accurately predict your conversion rate, and the viability of the entire business may depend on it. The goal is to recover your CAD within 12 months, otherwise the company will need too much capital to grow. 

Writing a business plan without market research is a sure shot to Armageddon. We therefore recommend drawing up an execution plan that focuses on figuring out what the numbers will be in the first few months of your company's life cycle, and not in the long run. If you're in the idea phase and you don't want to spend big sums to build something your customers don't want, you don't have customers. Your idea must be to publish something that offers the core value of your startup and solves the customer's core problem. 

The investment you need to develop your app idea depends on many variables, but it could be a prototype. If you have an idea for an app, a product, or even just a concept for a business idea, this investment represents the time you spend developing the product. This can range from a few thousand dollars for the first version of your product to high six-figure amounts for a first version product. Since banks and individual situations differ, it is best to look for financing options between $5,000 and $500,000. 

If you have a technology start-up, you need more capital to really get going (hiring people, buying office space, for example) than you can afford through bootstrapping or crowdfunding. The best starting point is angel investors, usually established business professionals, who want to invest in promising companies. Typically, angels invest between $1,000 and $5,500 a month in the first few years of life. 

A business plan is an essential piece of the financial puzzle, as it explains exactly how much money you need, where it needs to go, and how long it will take to earn it back. The rare exception are special cases where the investor knows the entrepreneur well and is willing to invest in him at an early stage. Even at this early stage, you are expected to have a business plan in the background for your own use. Investors will look first at your summary and then at your pitch, but before they get to the screening, they will want to see your business plans and the process of due diligence. The next step is to flesh out your business plan, and even if you've forgotten the screenings, it's still important. Once you are sure there is a market for it, build a prototype, apply for a patent, or present it at a conference. 

A good business plan will help you see how you will think about product marketing and make money from your product. Check out our guide to writing your business plans for more information on writing, marketing and business planning for startups. It can take a lot of time and hard work to turn an invention or idea into a profitable product. You need to channel your talents and ingenuity to create an organization you believe in. However, if you are organized and thorough, you can plan your financing and keep your startup budget on track. If you are thinking of starting a new business, you probably already know where to start with your finances.
