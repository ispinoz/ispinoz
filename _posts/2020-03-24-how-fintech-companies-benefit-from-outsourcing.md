The results also show that outsourcing software development is the only way to increase efficiency and flexibility for fintech companies. Indeed, IT outsourcing service providers offer specific solutions that allow financial institutions to adapt to develop an efficient IT environment for their technology services. In addition, this enables companies to transfer their valuable resources into their core business models. 

As customer behaviour changes and technology gains in importance, a new trend of outsourcing IT services is gaining momentum. Until recently, big data analytics was a key focus for outsourcing companies in the financial services industry. This is because financial startups simply do not have the resources to analyze bigData internally, let alone process it in-house. 

As a result, many have chosen to outsource the process to a vendor who has the analysis tools and software to deliver the required analysis. 

One of the areas identified for rapid growth is the outsourcing of software development for FinTechs. By outsourcing fintech development, companies are likely to increase productivity by at least 50%. 

Manual work is expensive and slow, but automated processes and innovative solutions save time and money. Cost reductions and improvement of customer service and product quality at a lower budget increase the competitive advantage. With fewer employees needed to work directly with customers every day, fewer customer waiting times, and a greater focus on the customer experience, outsourcing financial technology development reduces unnecessary time, overheads, and costs as banks avoid the extra effort of entertaining large staff. 

Fintech outsourcing solutions help companies minimize capital expenditures, giving them more flexibility to manage processes and invest in new technologies to meet growth. By optimising the processes that control companies, fint-tech solutions can reduce costs in the long term. 

The lack of blockchain experts remains a small problem in some parts of the world, so finding competent blockchain developers in many countries was literally a problem a few years ago. IT companies outsourcing developer services is not just about saving money; it is also a kind of fintech outsourcing that can be a real game - a game changer for many companies that need to deploy custom software without sacrificing their ability to invest in their own technology. This seems to be particularly the case when a high level of expertise is required in a particular area such as the blockchain. 

By outsourcing parts of software development, fintech companies can harness the power of technology in their products and gain access to specialized knowledge. Moreover, in a country with a high cost of living, such as the United States or Europe, it may be even more difficult to have workers. How outsourcing helps: By outsourcing part of software development, a Finterech company can gain access to expertise and harness energy technology for its product. Because outsourcing teams are fully scalable, experts can be hired at lower cost, eliminating the need to hire expensive specialists, which also entails high overhead costs. 

Fintech startups can rely on experience, expertise and expertise in the market to support their product development strategy. In addition, the start-up can partner with companies that have the intellectual capital needed to drive innovation in this area. 

Outsourced software development services provide managers and experts with appropriate optimization times. This will help the company to increase productivity and reduce costs in terms of time and development costs. 

This process also increases the professionalism of the process and reduces the workload to a more appropriate sharing of responsibility. Not mentioned here are the increased costs associated with the change in infrastructure and business processes. 

Indeed, it has been reported that 60% of start-ups are outsourcing their financial technology mainly for cost reasons. This is because start-ups prefer fintech, because outsourcing can reduce costs by up to 40 percent, rather than getting white-label software or building their own. 

You can count on the money you can save by using fintech, but you can't count on how much more you get out of it. Banks can access highly skilled developers by outsourcing their technological development abroad. For example, if JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America want to develop fint-tech, they will look abroad. 

They would do well to harness this skilled talent if they are to compete, and a strong offshore development company can give them a competitive advantage over their fintech competitors. 

According to Deloitte's Global Outsourcing Survey 2018, "Disruptive outsourcing today consists of working with partners in the market to integrate services that businesses can build and innovate to drive growth and unsettle their competitors," with an additional emphasis on financial inclusion. While many fintech startups flourish at the top of the financial market, the need for financial inclusion lies elsewhere. Some of these companies were set up with outsourced development workers who could not afford them full-time.
