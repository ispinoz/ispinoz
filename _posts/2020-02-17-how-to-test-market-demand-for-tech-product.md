Prototyping is an essential part of UI and UX design because it allows designers to visualize and experience their applications instantly. 

With the increasing possibilities of mobile devices and mobile app development tools, it is becoming increasingly easy to access both free and paid tools to create and test products. Prototyping apps and tools such as Google Glass and Apple's App Store act as prototyping tools for both mobile and desktop applications, allowing designers to see wireframes of their app and see where mobile design is going wrong. One of the great things about prototype app tools like Google Play and iOS is that designers don't have to spend a lot of money on software to "see" a designer's mockup application, making it a much simpler, less expensive - more effective kind of prototype. 

For mobile app developers, it is useful to have a mockup version of their app, but a highly interactive mockup is even more necessary. Wireframes are a step where developers view digital sketches of a developer's app or website and arrange user interface (UI) elements to see what their application will look and feel like before proceeding with programming. They provide information about navigation and interface components that the designer has planned. 

This is a page-based, layer-based or even a combination of both, such as a website and a mockup of a mobile app. 

Now there are tools that make this type of prototype easier than programming, such as wireframes. Layer-based prototyping tools, however, allow interface elements to be made interactive and animated, so that it can be done in a way that is normally difficult. It is a Y - Combinator based company that has been taken over by Google, which allows you to create wireframes with high fidelity without writing any code. 

High - Fidelity wireframes are harder to create because they reflect what the app will actually look like, as opposed to low fidelity wireframes, which are essentially rough static dummies that are usually made on paper. 

This allows you to verify your ideas with your team and help you verify the usability of your mobile app by visualizing and navigating through different screens without getting distracted by the visual design. If you are outsourcing your app and it needs to be designed by a company, it is very important that it has a complete knowledge of the ideas and expectations associated with it. 

Once you know you're on the same page, wireframing can help. First, consider the current market demand for your mobile app and the potential of your app for the future. 

Good wireframing must be able to close the information gap between designer and developer, not only in terms of current market demand, but also in terms of future demand. 

With a simple online app like Wirify, you can create wireframes for your favorite websites with a single click. It's time to make sure you don't get the right design before you start writing code. A wireframe from WebSoco explains how to design your website "correctly." 

If you have ever programmed a mockup and used it in a test tool, you can use it to perform some quick - and - dirty tests. UserTesting.com suggests testing with the rough mockups and ideas you have, and then testing with revised prototypes. There's nothing wrong with testing your users on a regular website, but do it only with early wireframes and dummies to get preliminary feedback. 

You are still researching the underlying product idea, but you have not yet started product design, and this would only slow down the learning process. Prototyping (or more precisely, reactions to prototypes) will help you better understand your proposed features and whether or not you have an idea worth pursuing. It could take a long time to build a more perfect prototype, so start with a viable product (MVP) later. 

A relatively new and effective way to find developers for your project is through crowdsourcing marketplaces like 99designs and CrowdSPRING. These services have a community of designers and developers who create designs according to your needs and allow you to choose the best ones you want to work with. They will also want to look at their portfolios and introduce them to previous clients to see if their work has the quality you want in developing your idea. 

Determine the proposed fee for your project and only pay if you select the winner or pay for the entire project (up to a maximum of $10,000 for a full design and $1,500 for an individual). 

The question is, does your start-up need permanent employees right away, or can you get things going without them? You may have started looking for a technology-oriented co-founder to help you introduce your idea, only to find that you cannot afford the ongoing salary of a qualified software developer. You don't know anything about programming or development, so you have to start from scratch.
