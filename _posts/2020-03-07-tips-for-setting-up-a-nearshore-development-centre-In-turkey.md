A Near Development Centre is an offshore team of integrated talent that provides software development services to businesses and is based abroad but close timezones. Nearshore technology outsourcing is by definition the employment of a team of specialists from a neighbouring country to carry out business tasks.

Outsourcing is one of the most important aspects of business development in Turkey and the Middle East in general.

American companies and organizations are also affected by this difference, but for our customers the difference is greater for those in Western Europe.
