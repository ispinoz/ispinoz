Some of you work in roles that have never been so far away, so your manager can try to measure the productivity of your team. 

It is easy to assess performance remotely when you set clear performance and deadlines for your employees. Setting clear expectations increases the productivity of employees and enables them to structure their day in such a way that they can best achieve their goals. Your team leader or manager needs actionable tips to help his staff stay on track. 

Companies large and small alike are taking the right steps to measure and improve productivity and performance remotely with the help of remote teams and their employees. 

What are your team's performance standards and how will you measure productivity and other critical aspects that are best discussed at the beginning of the working relationship? Analyze the performance of your remote team based on the employee's job description and extract 10 Must - Do things that can significantly improve your daily performance management for employees. Focus on these new techniques to manage the performance of your employees and analyze the impact of remote teams on their performance and productivity. 

If completing tasks is a measurable goal for your team's performance, task managers like Asana and Jira can help you track tasks as they are completed and add results. These tools serve as a quick look at performance and help to organize the most important results in one place. Performance management tools such as 15five and Impraise combine performance with employee engagement and track the performance of your remote team members and their performance. 

In most cases, everyone on your virtual team can access their work anytime and from any device. If your team is working temporarily or permanently from home, make sure you communicate your work expectations. 

You can measure productivity by defining clear and specific work parameters from the outset. These indicators should have the greatest influence on the business success of your company and ideally should be measurable. 

Key metrics used to measure sales staff performance may include, for example, the volume of calls, turnover and revenues generated. A typical quantitative measure could be the number of sales calls per day or the percentage of calls in the past month to measure productivity and knowledge at work. Unless the metrics show otherwise, trust your remote employees to work hard to accomplish the tasks assigned to them. 

You will see how they work and their ability to achieve the goals, and through evaluation the company can announce its goals. The evaluation of remote employees is the first step to ensure that you are working towards the best ROI for your remote employees. Planning involves understanding what work can be done remotely, building trust with team members, equipping them with the right tools to work together, and judging them on their work ethic and commitment to the project. 

Whether you're forming a new remote team or struggling to manage it, these three steps will help you take advantage of a highly productive team wherever it works. If you find that your company can work with an emote team, you need to know what kind of infrastructure and tools your employees need. 

To achieve the productivity your business needs, you need to provide a minimum of resources to enable effective management. When it comes to employee performance, work without clear goals that can be easily tracked and evaluated can be a recipe for disaster. 

What happens is that you measure performance when you distract yourself and forget about the finish line. Reaching the finish line can blur the line between what you have done and how you got there, leaving you with a lot of information that runs counter to your goals and not the information you want to pursue if you want to develop a more efficient performance strategy. Set yourself a clear target for your team's performance and make a habit of checking it regularly. 

If you cannot see who is working what during the day, avoid judging performance on the basis of the hours worked and the number of hours worked. Effectively managing a remote team requires a combination of technology that makes it possible to work from the office and remote employees who do the work for you. If the company does not provide you, please check Capterra's top products to see if the technology makes sense for your business. 

Once the technology is in place, don't forget to focus on promoting experience with the benefits of a team remotely. This is especially useful if you are following your own remote sales teams, such as face-to-face meetings, distance training or field trips. 

KPs, set up to measure employee performance, should be consistent with the organization's overarching goals. In addition, a well-designed KPI allows remote employees to see how their performance affects the overall success of your organization, as well as their impact on the overall performance of the company.
