title: How To Scale Your Distributed Development Team?
---

The distributed development team model can be challenging if the right people, processes and tools are not in place. Distributed development teams may have difficulty achieving results because they do not work according to the same principles or have a common understanding of project objectives. With the right approach, you can avoid or overcome these common challenges and become a powerful team that likes to work together to achieve business benefits.

However, there is a method to eliminate the negative elements associated with distributed development teams, and to enable all stakeholders to work in a highly collaborative and productive way. This method is known as agile, and based on my experience, the following examples are the best practices for distributed teams using the agile scrum method. The agile method has been around for some time, but it is rapidly becoming one of the most popular methods for distributed development teams today. Although it has a number of advantages over traditional agile methods such as continuous integration and continuous deployment, there is a lot of potential to make it equally successful in collaboration with distributed development teams. Learn how to avoid failure, discover the importance of UX and UI in agile methodology sologies, and learn more about how they work and how to learn from them. 

In this paper, we will examine the challenges faced by agile software development teams, which are becoming increasingly distributed and interdependent, and give an overview of some of the specific problems that Atlassian has faced and continues to face with rapid growth. If you're hungry for more, you can read a blog below highlighting how the Jira team has addressed the scaling issues with product enhancements and basically created features that make their lives easier. Based on their own scaling attempt - and faults - we took our product development team with us and asked ourselves, "What will project management look like in five years? How will we sustain our ever-growing team of over 1,000 employees over the next five years and how will we keep in touch with them? A similar problem exists when a team focuses on a single component, resulting in too many employees, too little time and too few resources. The result of this team alone cannot deliver anything, but the fact that the team is functionally silenced is a sign that none of them can deliver anything of value on their own. If you're trying to scale flexibly in the hierarchy, focus on making sure your existing structure works in an agile way that isolates the people in your team from each other. 

When you work with a squatted team or a distributed organization, you focus on creating distributed teams - teams that are fully functional, not scattered, and whose individual members are spread across multiple geographies. This greatly reduces the number of coordination points within the organization and enables a given agile team to reach a higher level of performance more quickly. You just have to coordinate dependencies with other teams and support groups, and that allows for a more efficient and efficient development process. 

Project costs are lower for a distributed development team than for an onshore team, and agility is increased by ensuring that each team has the necessary capabilities to provide a fully functional function. They can set up special teams to ensure a high level of relevant skills and expertise, allowing flexibility when teams are behind. Although it is easier to scale a team if the resource pool is familiar with core functionality, the amount of time you spend learning the functionality will only add up to a small additional cost. If you have a complex project that requires a wide range of development skills, please contact us to learn more about how First Line can leverage distributed development to ensure that the right skills are deployed at a high level of quality work and productivity. The aim of the Three Amigos meeting should be to promote the development of features that are ready for further development. 

Many organizations on an agile scaling trip also take the opportunity to adopt a set of principles to guide them through their journey, which is helpful in outlining the type of collaboration they are trying to achieve. The use of tools such as the Agile Development Toolkit (ADT) and the Lean Development Process can help in collaboration between project teams. I have been involved in Agile Development since 2006 and have been in a distributed development setup for over a year. During my last assignment, we set up an offshore software development center, expanded it to 50 employees, groomed the next level of agile executives, and successfully embedded agile concepts and strategies.
