One of the challenges of managing and working within a remote team involves choosing the right software solution to increase collaboration and productivity.

We'll show the common challenges faced by remote teams and some actionable tips to effectively collaborate and achieve the best results.

Managing remote teams can be challenging and communication can bring some setbacks to companies who are trying to steer their virtual employees in the right direction.

Although remote work flexibility has been a sought - after career perk in recent years, teams still need the right tools and resources in place to ensure they can adapt to new challenges around collaboration, accessibility, and logistics.

Companies should ask if demanding synchronous communication is impacting their team's ability to reason and process challenges in the most efficient and healthy way.

Companies will keep resorting to dedicated development teams whenever they need to save money, find a developer quickly or work with a niche technology.

For many established businesses and startups alike, offsite development is the first thing that comes to their mind when getting a new business idea off the ground.

When you want talent and technology diversity as well as scalability and flexibility, hiring development teams offsite is better than altering an in - house software development team.

If none of your current employees wants to turn their career around and invest months in learning a new technology, let an offsite domain expert do the job.

Agile is most commonly used to build software however it is appearing more and more frequently as a work style within larger projects in other areas of businesses such as new product development and even marketing campaigns.

A dedicated team of developers is flexible, which means they can start working on your project much faster than their in - house counterparts.

By outsourcing even a small project to another team, you give your in - house developers time to focus on the critical assignments.

And because the dedicated development team is scalable, you can have the exact number of people needed to work on the project at different stages.

A dedicated team is super fast in terms of onboarding, which is critical if you have a strict deadline for the project.

A developer who's only been putting work for their official job and has no GitHub repositories and projects to boast is clearly not going to be someone you'll trust right away.

Individually, each member should take care of one release so that every single team member will know how to handle them.

To give each member of the company an equal view of how the organization is structured, how job levels / families are established, and what reporting structures look like, it's wise to consider a publicly accessible org chart.

All - remote companies must empower every member of the team, across every function and job level, to approach their work with an iterative mindset.

By creating a transparent work culture, managers empower team members to be accountable for the results ( both successful and not ).

Whenever there is need to work on a specific, high - level, cross functional business problem, a working group should be established for that need.

Things can get messy when communication doesn't happen in the right place, gets lost in tons of emails or chat messages, etc.

Miscommunications as things get lost in translation - communicating primarily over messaging apps and online workspaces leaves room for ambiguity and misunderstanding that may not happen when teams are together and can see body language and hear tone.

No matter what communication channel you choose, as long as everyone properly introduces themselves, the communication will be more comfortable and efficient.

They are fluent in all formats of communication technology ( email, chat, video conference ) and are flexible and available ( within reason ) when you want to connect.

The flexibility that comes with remote working allows employees to ditch all the stress that comes with commuting to and from work.

Some companies value the freedom and flexibility that comes with remote work while some appreciate the opportunity to work with talented professionals unrestricted by geographical boundaries.

The Millenial and Gen Z population will strive to keep a work - life balance and would opt for a company that offered flexible working arrangements than those who don't.

This will make them feel that they are an integral part of the company and can help alleviate the loneliness that may come with remote work.

In fact, according to a 2018 study on the state of remote work, 21 % of freelancers and employees believe that loneliness is the biggest struggle with working virtually.
