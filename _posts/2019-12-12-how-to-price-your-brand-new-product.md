Competitive prices are also called competitive prices or competitors based on prices, but they differ from prices based on value. 

The pricing of your product is a combination of competitive prices and value - based pricing as well as the cost of the product itself. For entrepreneurs who want to determine a value - based on price - Dolansky gives the following advice. On the following pages you will learn how to achieve your business objectives for the pricing of your product, which factors need to be taken into account in pricing and how to determine whether you should increase or decrease the price as well as the cost of the product itself. The first step is to get a clear picture of what you want to achieve with your pricing strategy and what money you want to earn. Earning money means generating enough revenue from the product you sell to cover your costs, make a profit, and perhaps expand your business. When analyzing prices, consider the cost of time, money, and materials that the company can recoup by providing sales, marketing, advertising, customer service, and other services.
