It is imperative that we transform our workplaces and training centres digitally in order to be able to work effectively. But what if it is imperative to transform them digitally so that we can work effectively? 

According to a survey by Workhuman, only one-third of people in the United States worked from home during the pandemic. Even companies that reject the concept of distributed labor will be forced to allow work to be done at home if work can be done remotely, even if they take precautions to stop the spread of the virus. Those who use technology well to rethink their business models for the future, moving fast, will have been ahead of their competitors in pursuing digital transformation. 

When the coronavirus spread in the US, the CDC made drastic but wise recommendations to curb its spread, including limiting the number of people who could gather and telling them to avoid public places. Workers around the world were suddenly asked to quarantine themselves and to practice social distancing. Even if you had not contracted the virus, you felt the effects, even though you had not contracted it. 

We spoke to IDGTECHtalk on Twitter on March 12, 2020, and discussed whether companies are aware of the steps IT departments are taking to support remote workers and ensure their safety, and how the virus could change health technology forever. Security teams should continue to monitor unauthorized remote access methods by working proactively with BUs. If remote access needs to change drastically, organisations will face the possibility of employees or third parties attempting to take over services in an unauthorised manner. 

Remote working brings new risks to remote work organisations, in particular in the areas of security, privacy and data protection, and health and safety. 

While endpoint security solutions can be deployed, in crisis situations where solutions need to be implemented quickly, the cost of deploying and managing a variety of security layers is prohibitive. While each organization must take into account its own unique circumstances, we provide a comprehensive solution to keep operations safe and productive while keeping them safe. 

Our solution isolates remote work sessions and sensitive data from the user's device and browser. Without a direct connection to an untrusted network, no device or data remains at risk. 

Users will use personal devices, including home-based firewalls, which raise security concerns. We can also restrict downloads that mitigate vulnerabilities that are important for insider threats, such as remote access to sensitive data. 

In some cases, both at home and in the office, cable modems and firewalls will be in place, but these devices will no longer provide the protection and connectivity provided by the layers of technology in the back office. 

As long as the endpoints are secure, remote employees are protected from most threats. Instead of providing guidance on how to connect remotely, companies should think about how to connect to ensure that at least adequate antivirus programs are running on all connecting devices. 

Nevertheless, VPNs help employees to continue their work by accessing office applications remotely. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a quick death for VPN, as organizations examine which SaaS can meet business requirements and what remedies are in place to circumvent on-site security measures. 

The "silent sector" finds itself in a delicate situation under COVID-19, which cyber criminals are increasingly using to infiltrate organisations. Andy Heather, Centrify's vice president, said: "Cyber criminals will no doubt seek to seize the opportunity presented to them by remote staff who are not well trained. 

It is therefore crucial for businesses and workers to remain vigilant in this challenging time. It is about implementing an effective cyber security strategy and responding to a crisis of security competences. This includes introducing the importance of IT skills, such as the ability to run your IT and online infrastructure securely and detect unusual and potentially malicious activity. 

In the current COVID-19 situation, your security team should verify that the visibility of the endpoint remains consistent across all remote users, including new users and third parties. They should continue to take measures, such as reducing administrator privileges, and employees targeted with phishing emails will continue. 

A complete inventory of all systems connected to your organization so that you can scan them for misconfigurations will help you build a secure external network that handles business outside the office. Once an attacker gains access to a remote access solution, be it a VPN or virtualized desktop solutions, he will probably try to collect credentials and move sideways. IT teams will have to be behind the new systems to accommodate new users, new devices and new security solutions. 

With more things moving in and out of the cloud over the next few weeks, it is critical to have a clear view of what is in your company's cloud, whether it is a virtualized desktop, a remote access solution, or a physical system to determine ownership. IT is shadowed, abandoned, orphaned or even in a desolate state due to lack of maintenance, security or other reasons.
